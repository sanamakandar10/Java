This Project aims to create a Java project that converts currency. This currency calculator can convert between the dollar,euro, rupee, andyen. 
We `are going to use a switch and function to create a currency converter.

What are we building?
We are building a currency converter that allows the user to convert one currency to another, such as the dollar, yen, and rupee.

Pre-requisites
Switch statements in java We are going to use switch to get user choices
function in java: We are going to use the function to convert one current to another currency.
arithmetic operation in java: To convert one currency to another, we need to perform some arithmetic operation on the currency.

* First, we are going to take the user currency input in which currency he wants to enter the amount
* Then will take the amount of input from the user
* Then, using the switch case and function calculate the amount in the destinated currency
